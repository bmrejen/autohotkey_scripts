# My AutoHotKey scripts

This is a collection of my AHK scripts 

1. AutoHotkey_shortcuts.ahk

This is the entrypoint that loads everything

2. Chrome Backspace

Allows you to go to previous page by hitting Backspace (instead of Alt+Left)

3. Contextual Menu

Open the contextual menu with a dedicated key, press it again to close. 

Also used to close current Chrome tab by hitting Shift at the same time

4. Generate Password

Ctrl+U will put a random password in your clipboard

5. Google Selected

Ctrl+G will google current selection

6. Mouse

Allows you to control your cursor without a mouse. Hit NumLock and move around with your numpad

It's often more convenient than your real mouse

7. Personal shortcuts

They are optimized for a Lenovo Thinkpad keyboard

8. Remove US layout

Windows has a bug where it adds the US layout to the list of your current layouts. 
Hitting F4 allows to remove it

9. Spelling autocorrect
